# CAMPUSPALHV

This repository has 3 .ipynb files. Each file has a modification of same code, to suite the needs of different levels of question-answering system. Temperature, top_p values, and the prompt we give to the model affect the level and coherence of the answers generated. Gradio is deployed to visualize the answer generated by the NVIDIA's MICROSOFT Phi3 model. 
Dataset provided originally was in json format, it has been converted to pdf format.
